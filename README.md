## MY PHILOSOPHY

[**My Philosophy:**](https://youtu.be/YxXAlzNJZxU) The buzz word in product development is “value”. What stakeholders want is not a wish list of features. Everything must “drive value”. Whatever the product goals are (more users, efficiency, revenue), we prioritize based on these things. </br>

Think of your own business initiatives. To build anything costs money. You want your investment (costs of dev team) to be applied to features and functionality that will give you the biggest bang for the buck - and not $200k spent on a team building unimportant things that don’t move the needle. </br>

KPIs are success metrics on any product or project. Stakeholders’ requests should map to these. This is also one way to weed out bad requests.

## WHY PARTNER WITH ME

"... I had the opportunity to work with Ann while consulting and training. She provided excellent "outside-in" perspective on the Product Management, Product Owner, Agile and Scrum disciplines. She balances the theoretical/defined Agile and Scrum practices with practical application for her company.
</br>

I called on her often while teaching the class to provide insights and validation based on her outstanding experience and background - she embraced the Market Driven Product Management concepts, while bridging them extremely well to applying them.
</br>

A top-notch individual! ..."
